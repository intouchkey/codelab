For each node $u$ reachable from $s$, if level($u$) is even, color it blue; otherwise, color it white. Since $G$ does not contain an odd-length cycle, by the previous lemma and a property above, each edge may only connect nodes whose levels differ by one, i.e. nodes in adjacent levels. Since nodes in adjacent levels are assigned different colors, it follows that there is no edge connecting nodes of the same color.\n",
